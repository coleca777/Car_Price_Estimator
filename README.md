# Car_Price_Estimator
This project tests various machine learning models to estimator the price of a used car based on various parameters

This is my semester project for Georgia Tech's CS 4641, Machine Learning, class. It was done along with Ethan Povlot, Matheus Santos, Donaven Lobo, and Fernando Sanz. This project used a Dense Neural Network, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Linear Regression. Here is the [link](https://github.gatech.edu/pages/CS-4641-Project-Car-Value-Estimator/website/final.html) to see a video and paper created for this project.
